Data anlysis: jupyter notebooks

## Installation

Data from experiments was analysed in Jupyter Notebooks in Python 3.7. To work on notebooks install anaconda 3 distribution from: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

All scripts contain filepaths optimized for macOS or Linux and will not be work on Windows.

## Experiments

Repository contains noteboks with data analysis. Each notebook works on a data from following experiments:
- behavioral tests
- contractility tests
- morphometric characterisation of neuromuscular junctions
- oxyblot. 

Additionally 2 notebooks contatin calibration of the measurement method (both of them are in Polish language): 
- BCA protein concentration measurement
- NanoDrop nucleic acid concentration measurement


### Contractility tests

Experiment with contractility tests contain program which was written to perform computational simulation of data analysis in different methods in all combinations and collect data from each simulation. More description about program is available in "contractility-tests.ipynb" file.
