# Analysis of the data form master thesis: 

Repository contatins Methodology of data analysis, which was used in master thesis perforemd in Animal Development Department at the Wroc≈Çaw Uniwersity in Poland. Description, methodology and data from experiments will be available in master thesis content (will be available in 2020). Notebooks with analysis contain data generated randomly or changed. 

**This repository contains randomly generated data** (to avoid copyright issues) in csv files in folder "data" (seperate csv file for each experiment). Data has the same table structure as real data from experiments. Cropped samples of images are in folder "images". 

## Installation

Data from experiments was analysed in Jupyter Notebooks in Python 3.7. To work on notebooks install anaconda 3 distribution from: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

All scripts contain filepaths optimized for macOS or Linux and will not be work on Windows.

## Experiments

Repository contains noteboks with data analysis. Each notebook works on a data from following experiments: behavioral tests, contractility tests, morphometric characterisation of neuromuscular junctions and oxyblot. Additionally 2 notebooks contatin calibration of the measurement method: BCA protein concentration measurement and NanoDrop nucleic acid concentration measurement and both of them are in Polish language. 


### Contractility tests

Experiment with contractility tests contain program which was written to perform computational simulation of data analysis in different methods in all combinations and collect data from each simulation. More description about program is available in "contractility-tests.ipynb" file.
